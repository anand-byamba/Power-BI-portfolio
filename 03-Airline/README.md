# ✈️ Airline Performance Data Analysis

On the first page of the visualization, we can see basic information about the airlines, such as the number of routes per airline, the number of airlines in each region, and their distribution by currency.

On the second page, we observe the correlation between load factor and Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT). Each dot represents a different airline. By clicking on a data point, detailed information about the selected airline appears in the bottom-left corner of the dashboard. In the bottom-right corner, we can choose to include or exclude low-cost airlines.
